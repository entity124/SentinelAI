# AI Model Factsheet: GuardianAI Predatory Pattern Detector

**Governance Status:**  ✅ Compliant (IBM Watsonx Track)
**Model ID:** `guardian-granite-3.1-3b-lora-v1`
**Base Model:** `ibm-granite/granite-3.1-3b-a800m-instruct`
**Fine-tuning Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
**Date Created:** 2026-01-14

## 1. Intended Use
- **Purpose:** Analyze financial transaction streams to detect predatory subscription patterns affecting vulnerable populations (elderly, low-income).
- **Primary output:** Classification (`is_predatory`: boolean), `pattern_type` (Enum), and `reason` (Natural Language Explanation).
- **Target Users:** Financial Institutions, Guardians, Caretakers.

## 2. Training Data
- **Source:** Synthetic transaction dataset (`train.jsonl`, `train_micro.jsonl`).
- **Composition:** 3,700+ sequence examples simulating subscription lifecycles.
- **Key Features:**
  - `price_escalation`: Sudden increasing costs after trial periods.
  - `dormancy`: Continued billing with zero user activity.
  - `difficulty_to_cancel`: Patterns resembling "roach motel" dark patterns.
- **Demographics:** Data simulates diverse user profiles to ensure robustness across spending behaviors.

## 3. Performance & Limitations
- **Metric:** Fraud Detection Accuracy (Target: >90% on validation set).
- **Known Limitations:**
  - **Context Window:** Analyzes limited transaction history (last 10-20 transactions per merchant).
  - **False Positives:** Legitimate price increases (e.g., annual inflation) may occasionally be flagged. Human review recommended.
  - **CPU Inference:** Currently optimized for throughput, not latency, on local CPU deployment.

## 4. Ethical Considerations (Responsible AI)
- **Fairness:** Tested against "Vulnerable Customer" profiles (Elderly, Students) vs "Standard" profiles to ensure equal protection accuracy.
- **Explainability:** Every flag includes a natural language reason generated by the Granite model, providing transparency to the end-user (not just a black-box score).
- **Privacy:** Model operates on tokenized transaction descriptions; no PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is trained or retained in the model weights.
